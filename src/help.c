  The Basics, as Explained by Master A to his Student, Q:\n\
    Q: What is the point of this game, master?\n\
    A: To score as highly as possible before you die.\n\
    Q: How do I score?\n\
    A: You score points whenever your paddle strikes a ball. Furthermore,\n\
       the faster the ball is going, the more points you will score.\n\
    Q: And how do I die?\n\
    A: You die, my son, when your lives run out.\n\
    Q: Well, then how do I prevent my lives from running out?\n\
    A: By being vigilant, and always keeping the trigger from falling\n\
       below the bottom of the window.\n\
    Q: Master, I know not what this \"trigger\" you speak of is.\n\
    A: The trigger, my young learner, is the ball which is the same color\n\
       as your paddle.\n\
    Q: Ah yes, learned master, I've noticed that my paddle is always\n\
       changing colors, just as the humming bird never stands still.\n\
    A: When the trigger hits a ball of another color, then that ball\n\
       becomes the trigger, and that is why your paddle changes.\n\
    Q: So the trigger is the ball which is the same color as my paddle,\n\
       and when the trigger hits another ball, then that new ball becomes\n\
       the trigger, and my paddle changes to that new color. If I ever miss\n\
       the trigger, and it falls beneath the bottom of the window, then I\n\
       will lose a life. And if I lose all my lives, then I will die. Is\n\
       that right, master?\n\
    A: Yes, gifted one, that is correct. You have come a long way, but you\n\
       have more to learn before you can be a master like me...\n\

  Master A Explains Special Balls\n\
    Q: Master, what are these balls, some of which has letters on\n\
       them, which possess powers unlike the other balls?\n\
    A: These are special balls, my curious child.\n\
    Q: Why doesn't my paddle change color when the trigger hits these\n\
       \"special\" balls, master?\n\
    A: A special ball cannot become the trigger. The gods forbid it.\n\
    Q: So how can I recognize a special ball, master. It is clear that\n\
       they have magical powers, and cannot be taken lightly.\n\
    A: There are three kinds of special balls, my pupil:\n\
       o The \"blackout\" ball, which is dark and colorless. You should\n\
         not strike this ball, or the evil spirits that possess it\n\
         will blind you. Then you will not be able to tell one ball\n\
         from another!\n\
       o The \"slowpad\" ball, which has the mark of a red \"S\" on its\n\
         belly. It will infect your paddle with weakness, so that it\n\
         can only move at one half its usual speed.\n\
       o The \"fastpad\" ball, which bears a green \"F\". This ball is\n\
         beneficial and will speed your paddle up for a short time.\n\
    Q: Ah, so there are three kinds of special balls: A dark one, one\n\
       with a red \"S\", and one with a green \"F\". The first two are\n\
       harmful, and that third is beneficial. None of these balls can\n\
       become the trigger, so if the trigger strikes them, my paddle\n\
       won't change colors. Is that correct, master?\n\
    A: Yes, my child. You have learned much, but there is still a\n\
       little more to you must know, before you are a master...\n\
