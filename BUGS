	Bugs that I know about but haven't fixed yet:

	o A bug which may throw the game into an infinite loop,
	  freezing it, will occur when some object is "squeezed"
	  between two others. (Such as a ball between the paddle
	  and a wall. This actually does occur occasionally in
	  real gameplay, although it most likely results in a
	  massive increase in ball speed and score, rather than
	  a freeze. With the help of a debugger, the case where
	  the game actually freezes can be constructed. This can
	  be done by placing a ball between two other balls, or a
	  ball between a wall and the paddle.)
